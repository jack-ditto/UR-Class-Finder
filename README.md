# UR Class Finder

A proposed class finder tool for University of Richmond classes, built using Angular 6 with a <a href="https://github.com/jack-ditto/UR-Class-Finder-Flask-API">Flask backend</a>


## Background
I built this tool because I was learning the Angular Javscript framework at the time and it seemed like a great application for a tool that I know would make many students' lives easier (including my own). This repo contains the Angular portion of the application and the Flask backend portion <a href="https://github.com/jack-ditto/UR-Class-Finder-Flask-API">can be found here.</a>


## How does it work? 
The website allows a user to search the class catalog for the University of Richmond and select sections of a class that they would like to take, similair to adding items to a shopping cart.

After adding classes, the user can then go to their planner and generate a list of the most optimal schedules that include the classes they selected.

The user has the option to run the algorithm for finding the best schedule with only the _sections_ they selected, or with the default option of finding schedules with the selected _classes_. 

## The Algorithm

The algorithm I chose to use for this was the Bronâ€“Kerbosch Maximal Clique finding algorithm. This problem breaks down into an interval scheduling maximization problem (ISMP), and at the end of the day it is an NP-Hard problem. 

## Some things I would (and may still) do differently

There are many things I would change about this project with the knowledge I have today. 
- The "Database" is an excel spreadsheet. Obviously this isn't the most efficient technique for storing and serving data. 
- The algorithm is implemented client side in Typescript in the Angular application. If I did this again all of the grunt work would be done server-side. 
- Angular is a pretty heavy framework for such a simple application. I was learning it at the time, but I could build the same application now with React.js and it would be much smaller and manageable. 

And I am sure there are many other changes I would make. When I have time I am going to completely rebuild this project, but I thought I would still share it for inspiration!
